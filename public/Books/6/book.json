  "Description": "Anomaly detection is vital for maintaining data integrity in a data-driven world. This paper discusses challenges like defining anomalies, imbalanced datasets, evolving data distributions, interpretation issues, and noise/outliers. Machine learning techniques, including unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised learning, are explored for addressing these challenges. Methods such as density-based approaches, clustering techniques, isolation forests, and gated recurrent units (GRU) are highlighted. By leveraging machine learning, organizations can effectively detect anomalies across diverse data types and environments. As data complexity grows, robust anomaly detection systems become increasingly crucial for data security and integrity.",
